# Services in Go: from Proof-of-Concept to Production 

It's easy to solve problems in go, but there's a big difference from 
works-on-my-machine to doesn't-break-at-2am-in-production. I'll walk you 
through the build tools, dependency management and deployment techniques 
to get your work into production; then we'll discuss how to do the 
service configuration, coordination and management tools to gracefully 
handle changes in production; and finally the metrics, logging and 
monitoring tools to tackle performance tuning, capacity planning and 
tracking down those bugs that only happen under production load.
